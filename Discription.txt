Introduction to C
******************

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, 
with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting use 
in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer 
architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.A successor to the programming language B, C was originally developed at Bell
Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to construct utilities running on Unix. It was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. 
During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors
available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (ANSI C) and by the 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently
to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming.
A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes 
to its source code.

Problem statement
*****************
Problems faced during the admission of the students in the college or 
Hostel. Management faces some serios problems during this time.

And in computer-based data management system we just need to upload the data to 
the program itself and it can be used any time for the report generation and for 
looking at various statistics.

Hardware requirement
********************
C programming can be basically run on any workstation which has UNIX system, MS-DOS
system, Windows system, UNIX like Solaris, IRIX, GNU/Linux, BSD, Mac OS, Fedora.
All u need is as a minimum, you should have at least amount space for data and a processing RAM of good quality requirement is enough run a c programming in a system. A keyboard for a system and mouse is a basic necessity for handling a system.


Software requirement
********************
There is a large amount of software on which we can run a C program. To construct a C program all 
we need is a text editor and a C compiler. All we need the files we create with our editor are called 
the source files and they contain the program source codes. The source files for C programs are 
typically named with the extension ".c".
The source code written in source file is the human readable source for your program. It needs to be 
"compiled", into machine language so that your CPU can actually execute the program as per the instructions 
given. The compiler compiles the source codes into final executable programs. The most frequently used and free 
available compiler is the turbo C++, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the 
respective operating systems.
